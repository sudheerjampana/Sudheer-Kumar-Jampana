Tandemloop stage-1: First Screening Test


As the part of Tandemloop stage-1 : first screening test, I Have solved four basic problems using "Python Programming Language".
Problem-1:
Description: The Problem-1 Is to Write Code to implement simple class based Calculator with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
step1: Create a class as calculator.
step2: Initialized inputs by constructor.
a: float value from the user
b: float value from the user
op: which operation to be perform on both values (a,b) and it is string

Note: Here, op is given as("+","-","*","/") or ("Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication", "Division")

step3: Checking the which operation to be perform by the user using conditional statements.
step4: perform operation based on operation to be given
step5: run program
inputs: a=1,b=2,op="Division" or "/"
output: 0.5


Problem-2: Generate First N Odd Numbers
Description:
The program should generate a list of the first a odd numbers.
Steps:
1. Read an integer a from the user.
2. Initialize an empty list res to store odd numbers.
3. Use a loop to generate numbers starting from 0.
4. Apend numbers to the list only if they are odd (i % 2 == 1).

Problem-3: Odd Values Based on Integer Input
Description:
If the input a is odd → generate first a odd numbers.
If the input a is even → generate first a - 1 odd numbers.
Steps:
1. Take input a from the user.
2. Check if a is odd.
3. If odd → create a list of a odd numbers.
4. If a is even → create a list of a - 1 odd numbers.
5. Print the list.

Problem-4: Factors of List of Numbers
Description:
We need to count how many numbers in a given list are divisible by numbers from 1 to 9.
Steps:
1. Take a list of integers as input (space-separated).
2. Initialize an empty dictionary dct.
3. Loop through divisors 1 to 9.
4. For each divisor, count how many numbers in the list are divisible by it.
5. Store the count in dictionary with divisor as key.
6. Print the dictionary.

Stop when the list reaches length a.

Print the list of odd numbers.
